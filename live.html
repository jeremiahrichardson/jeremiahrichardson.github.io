	<p> I was born in the small town of Rumford, Maine. Nestled into a quiet valley in the Western Foothills, I grew up in an area surrounded by beautiful views and hard-working people. I'm very fortunate to have spent my childhood in the isolated countryside of nearby Milton Township, an unorganized territory with approximately 70 residents. Nearly all of my eleven years there was spent playing in the outdoors for hours, either by myself or with my younger twin sisters. Whether it was snowmobiling, sledding, tapping trees, gardening, biking, or hiking, there was always something for me to do. It was during these early outdoor adventures that I began to develop my passion for an active lifestyle and an appreciation for the beautiful world around me. </p>
	 
	
	<p>  At the age of thirteen I moved back to Rumford, where I settled into my dad's converted general store. After serving as Army Officers during WWII, my grandparents purchased the general store in 1950. Over the years my grandparent’s business grew to include an antique shop, gas pumps, a deli, bakery, and a post office. Eventually they purchased a second store specializing in military surplus and firearms. Although operating two different stores proved to be challenging, they were successful because of their dedication to their customers and hard work ethics. After the passing of my grandfather, the store was ran by my dad until 2001.</p>
	
	<p>I've spent my whole life around the store, hearing my family's history and even living in the apartment above. I wouldn’t trade my experiences in the store for anything. I have memories of exploring the store at a young age. It was my personal jungle gym, with piles of old WWII surplus serving as obstacles to climb. The aged floor acted as my map, with past year's scuff marks guiding my adventure. These early memories are when I first thought to myself that I want be a storekeeper, just like my dad. I’ve been interested in business ever since, and I can't imagine doing anything else. </p>
