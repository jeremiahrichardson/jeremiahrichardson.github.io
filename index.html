        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I've created this website as a project for my BUA 235 class.</p>
	<p> I'm a Finance & Accounting double major at the Maine Business School with interests in business sustainability, financial management, and leadership studies.</p>
		<p> On campus I serve as the Treasurer of the American Marketing Association and as a Equity Research Analyst for the Student Portfolio Investment Fund. </p>
		<p> I'm also a member of the Sophomore Owls Honors Society. The Sophomore Owls is an all-inclusive honors and traditions society for the top 1% of male sophomore students. </p>
		
		<p>I invite you to explore my site so you can learn more about me and my interests.</p>
