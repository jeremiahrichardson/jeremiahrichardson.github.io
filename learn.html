	<p> I graduated from Telstar Regional High School in June, 2017. Telstar is located in the town of Bethel, a mountain village of about 2,000 residents. In high school I took advantage of the Honors and AP courses that Telstar offered, and was routinely named to both the Honor and High Honor rolls. While at Telstar I served a term as Class President and was a three year Student Council member. I also was in the concert band, and on the basketball and track and field teams. I am currently a first-year student at the University of Maine, where I'm pursing a career in business and law. I chose to attend the University of Maine because of it's academic reputation, location, affordablility, community impact, and the pride of being a Black Bear! </p>

	<p>Whether creating an investment portfolio, marketing a product, or running my own business, I want to reach the same level of success my father and grandfather achieved as business owners. Aside from business, my other interest is law. I love trying to understand our laws, why we have them, their purposes, loopholes, and their many different applications. Tied in with law is my affection for the political process. I've volunteered and worked for numerous political campaigns, and would like to eventually hold an elected positon of my own. I hope to pair my interest in law with my passion for business in order to get the most out of my future career. </p>
