	<p> Always encouraged to be well-rounded, I try my best to stay busy and live a meaningful life. When I'm not learning or working, I like to play! In my spare time I enjoy playing sports, volunteering in my community, and participating in local political campaigns. Basketball was the sport that I enjoyed playing the most. I played at Center during my four years at Telstar, and I made a lot of great memories in the process. Some of my favorite memories are when I hit a half-court bank shot in the closing seconds against Wiscasset, blocked the league MVP's shot against the backboard, and scored 32 points against Oxford Hills on my twin sisters' birthday.</p>
	
	<p> Although I've had a lot of great memories on the court, it's hard to beat the feel of making a positive impact in someone's life through  volunteering. My volunteering history started when I served as an area youth basketball coach. I had found a way to combine my love for basketball with a passion for community service. After serving as a coach, I've continued to volunteer my time with many more causes and organizations. Ranging from manual labor to assisting with Catholic Communion for those in elderly and hospice care, nothing beats knowing that my efforts are going towards making a positive impact in the lives of others. </p>
